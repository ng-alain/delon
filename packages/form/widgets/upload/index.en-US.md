Upload file widget by select or drag.

## Import module

Non-built-in modules, Should be import `UploadWidgetModule` in [json-schema.module.ts](https://github.com/ng-alain/ng-alain/blob/master/src/app/shared/json-schema/json-schema.module.ts#L11).

## Note

- **Must** set `resReName` to get correct data
- `multiple` determine return array or one element
- If `enum` or `asyncData` is set, it will be converted to `fileList` (`nzFileList`), and **must** initially guarantee a `response` property to indicate remote data and make sure `resReName` can be obtained correctly
- Image preview: by default, it uses `nzModal` to show `url` or `thumbUrl` of file object
