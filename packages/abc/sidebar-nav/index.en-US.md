NG-ALAIN The left main menu depends on `@delon/theme`.

The component data comes from `MenuService` (which is structured as [Menu](/theme/menu#Menu)), and the operation of `MenuService` is auto synchronized to the component.

## FAQ

### Why are there two shortcut menus?

The shortcut menu generation rules are uniformly searched under the `0` indexï¼Œand get in the following order:

1. [Recommended] children have `shortcutRoot: true` which is the highest priority
2. Otherwise, find the link with the word [dashboard], if it exists, create a shortcut entry below the menu.
3. Otherwise placed at the 0 node position

Therefore, it's recommended to keep a valid `shortcutRoot: true` data under the `0` index of the menu data.

### FAQ

**Hide main menu item**

You can set `hide: true` in the menu.

**About level**

**How to update a menu item**

The menu will be re-rendered via calling `MenuService.setItem(key, newValue)`, please refer to the definition of [Menu](/theme/menu#Menu).
