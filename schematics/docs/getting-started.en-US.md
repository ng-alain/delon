## Foreword

Using ng-alain scaffolding should as use as possible the `ng` command set provided by the Angular CLI to build, upgrade, etc., ng-alain also implemented some cool things:

- Build empty scaffolding with [ng add](/cli/add)
- Use [ng g](/cli/generate) to build modules, business pages
- Pluggable [plugin](/cli/plugin)

## Installation

We don't recommend directly cloning the git repository, but instead using `ng add` to build the ng-alain project, there are a few simple steps:

1. Create an empty angular project

```bash
# Make sure you are using the latest version of Angular cli
ng new demo --style less
```

2, add ng-alain scaffolding

```bash
ng add ng-alain --defaultLanguage=en
```

> If you any querstion, please refer to [FAQ](/docs/faq)

3, running

```bash
ng serve
```
