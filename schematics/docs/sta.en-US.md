## FAQ

### Path and Service Association

By default, the first `tags` of each `path` will be merged into one Service. Please use `[a-zA-Z][-_a-zA-Z]+` to describe `tag` as much as possible.

### Strange method name in the service?

By default, it will be processed according to the `operationId` item, otherwise it will be automatically combined according to the `path` and `method`.

### Global Response

When all `path`s have a fixed output format, such as success and exceptions have a unified format, they all return:

```json
{
   "status": 200,
   "error": "Error Message",
   "result": {}
}
```

If an interceptor is used to handle exception messages, when subscribing only needs to always get the data of the `result` field, it can be solved by specifying `--responseDataField="result"`.
