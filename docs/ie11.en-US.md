Differential loading has been supported since Angular8, when differential loading is enabled (which is the default) the CLI builds two separate bundles as part of your deployed application.

* The first bundle contains modern ES2015 syntax, takes advantage of built-in support in modern browsers, ships fewer polyfills, and results in a smaller bundle size.
* The second bundle contains code in the old ES5 syntax, along with all necessary polyfills. This results in a larger bundle size, but supports older browsers.

**And IE11 only supports the second bundle.**

By default, Angular will only generate this kind of differentiated build when `ng build --prod`. If the project needs deep support for IE, then additional configuration is required; for more details, please refer to the official website [Differential Loading](https://angular.io/guide/deployment#differential-loading).

At the same time, NG-ALAIN also provides a [plug-in IE](/cli/plugin#ie), so that the project supports the development of IE11.

## Note

NG-ALAIN is based on NG-ZORRO, and the minimum support for NG-ZORRO is IE11.
