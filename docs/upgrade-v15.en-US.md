## Before upgrade

1. Make sure `Node.js` >= `16.10.0`.
2. Create a new branch, or use other methods to back up the current project.
3. Delete the `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file.

### 1.Upgrade dependencies

- Upgrade Angular to 14.x version, Run `ng update @angular/core@15 @angular/cli@15 @angular-eslint/schematics@15 ng-zorro-antd@15 ng-alain@15`.
- _Run `ng update @angular/cdk@15`, if you have used `@angular/cdk`._
- **If any warning messages appear in the console, follow the prompts to modify the corresponding code.**

### QA

The following are optional upgrades:

**Remove `.browserslistrc`**

If you need to maintain the support of the old Chrome version, such as 360 browser, you need to restore it manually. For details, refer to [#2310](https://github.com/ng-alain/ng-alain/issues/2310#issuecomment-1299460266).

**Remove `polyfills.ts`, `test.ts`**
 
Angular15 on a mission to simplify the output of `ng new`, transfer more configuration items to `angular.json`, the advantage is that it can be better configured for different environments, you can refer to [#2351](https://github.com/ng-alain/ng-alain/pull/2351).
