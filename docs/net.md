ng-alain There are two default processings for any network request。

## 1、Expand HttpClient

`@delon/theme` Contains a class called [_HttpClient](//github.com/cipchk/delon/blob/master/src/core/theme/services/http/http.client.ts) ，The essence is calling Angular's  `HttpClient`，just wrapping add `loading`。

We know that ng-zorro-antd is flooded with a large number of `nzLoading` attributes, which allows for a more user-friendly loading of web requests so that we do not have to maintain a` loadind` variable on every business page。

Of course, not only that，`_HttpClient` Also unified processing of all time data format for the timestamp, which for the front-end state to ensure the consistency of the data has a good effect。

## 2、The default interceptor

The benefits of interceptors are self-evident;Uniform handling server request prefix，Uniform add `token` for each request,and so on。

The `src / app / core / net / default.interceptor.ts` file provides an implementation of the interceptor,  you can tailor to your own needs。
